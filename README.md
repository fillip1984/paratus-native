# Paratus

This is a react native implementation of another application I've built, [ex-nihilo](https://github.com/fillip1984/ex-nihilo). I'm attempting to convert to a mobile application that can send notifications to get better adoption. Right now, I seldom open ex-nihilo. I'm thinking that if I have an app that sends push notifications I'll actually stick to the habits I'm attempting to adopt.

## How to use

You create routines using the Planner tab. Routines generate activities on the Home (timeline). Each week you can check how you did. How many activities you skipped or completed.

## TODO

* [X] create sample routines import option
* [ ] Add profile image in top right on home that launches user preferences modal
* [ ] Add sunrise service to track sunlight
* [ ] Automatically generate activities when routine is created or updated.
* [ ] Generate interactions when completing activities
  * [ ] Blood pressure interaction
  * [ ] Run interaction
  * [ ] Weigh in interaction
  * [ ] Notes interaction

* [ ] Finish local push notifications
* [ ] Add 'seeking' repeat mode where you are prompted if you did something.
* [ ] Eventually an appropriate repeat schedule is generated.
* [ ] Hook up backend to track outcomes
